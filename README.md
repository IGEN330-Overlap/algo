# Overlaps Algorithm
This repository is used to collect, clean, and analyze spotify data to help prep and derive paramters for our implemented algorithms. We use it to conduct extensive exploratory analysis

## Use
To collect data use the GetSpotifyData.py file (make sure you have installed packages)

```bash
pip install spotipy
```
Change the query specification if you would like separate sets of data and adjust the saved .csv filename accordingly to not overwrite previous file.

With data can run notebooks and tinker to generate models
