# Overlaps Algorithm
Repo used to collect and investigate data that will be used to try help us build our playlist generation algorithm

## Use
To collect data use the GetSpotifyData.py file (make sure you have installed packages)

```bash
pip install spotipy
```
Change the query specification if you would like separate sets of data and adjust the saved .csv filename accordingly to not overwrite previous file.

With data can run notebooks and tinker to generate models
